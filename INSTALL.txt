Please note: This project is for Mac installation only.

This project uses the OCaml library CamlImages, as well as the OCaml 
graphics library and OCamlSDL. In order to install these libraries, first
run "opam install graphics" from the command line. This should also install
CamlImages, but in the event that it doesn't, also run "opam install
camlimages". Then, run "opam install ocamlsdl" and "opam install lablgl".
You will need both of these libraries in order to use the OCamlSDL
functionality used in this program. Finally, run "opam install conf-sdl-mixer".
(If the installations prompt you to download additional needed packages, 
install those from the command line using your corresponding package manager.)

To run this program, first run "make build" from the terminal. Then, 
run the command "make play", and if you choose to use the Image to Song Engine, 
enter the name of the image file as prompted.

Please note: Your image will need to be in the same directory you downloaded 
the project into. It also must be in PNG format.
